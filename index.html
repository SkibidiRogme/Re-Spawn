    <p>One day there was a man, lets call him James. James is a normal man with a happy family, he’s living the best 
        life, he has his dream job, a loving wife, two kids what could go wrong you may ask? James is a Engineer and 
        hes been assigned to work in a nuclear underground facility, there have been loose pipes and screws there and 
        James has been assigned to check on it. Its been 2 hours since hes started and its been going great everything 
        looks normal and James is about ready to pack, unfortunately a nuclear explosion erupts and it wipes out half 
        of the state of Texas. James is caught in the explosion, he can feel every molecule, every particle in his body 
        ripping apart he screams in agony only to hear the ringing of his ears reply back…</p>
        <br>
    <p>James awakens it felt like an eternity in complete darkness and light, his eyes flutter open as he sits up<br>
        <i>:the sun…</i><br>
        He says as he rubs his eyes, he looks at his body and realize hes alive. Utter shock and relief washes over James 
        as he gets up to see a fallen society, ash can be seen for miles, he wipes some ash off his uniform and realizes 
        hes alone now, his family, his friends, everything is now buried somewhere in the ash. He drops down to his knees 
        unable to cope with these emotions…</p>
        <br>
    <p>He stays in the same spot for several hours going through the stages of grief thats when a man walks 
            up to him covered in flames, he sits up as the man introduces himself, the man says hes 
            Tyler but people call him Pyro because he can control flames, thats when James is introduced to <del>transformed</del> awakened 
            people who have been blessed by the apocalypse and has obtained super human abilities.</p>
            <br>
    <p>Pyro and James travel to the <del>transformed</del> awakened head quarters the government has known their 
                existence and is trying to get a hold of them thats when James realize its been 
                2 years ever since the nuclear incident and several wars have been caused due to the transformed 
                declining to the governments experiments an all out war is still taking movement due to the racial 
                and and government disagreements. As James enters the headquarters he meets several super humans 
                with different abilities and Pyro’s friends come up to him and soon get along with James, they 
                figure out James have regeneration abilities…</p>
            <br>
    <p>Skip to the next day, James is getting suited up to join the war, James might be a broken man but 
        he still has morals and wants to fight for the rights of the <del>transformeds</del> awakeneds, he has been assigned as 
        a medic due to his new found skill that he acquired, he rushes into the battlefield saving numerous 
        lives of transformeds and after 8 long hours of battle the humans retreat and the transformed wins 
        this day, James walks back into their headquarters as many transformeds thank him for there were 
        no deaths that day, James smile as he sees his life coming up again, surrounded with people he trust…</p>
        <br>
    <p>James has been fighting aside the transformed for more than a week now his healing powers only getting better 
        by the day, things are looking bright for the transformeds, they have claimed new mexico and Arizona 
        thanks to James no one has died, a beautiful woman called Shine walks up to him, its his friend Shine gives 
        him a flirtatious wink and James smiles at her, Shines powers are simple he can blind enemies with extremely 
        powerful lights, they talk for a moment then get started to step into battle once again, as James steps 
        into the battlefield ready for another day of saving lives his comrades rush in to take Oklahoma 
        but this time things go terribly wrong as jets fly over them and releases another bomb called Planet Wiper, 
        it creates a crack on the very spreading from texas to Arizona and transformed falls, James feels the flesh 
        ripping pain again as his flesh, bone, internal organs get evaporated he reaches out to his friend Pyro for 
        the last time but its too late in his last thoughts he sees what could’ve been the future if they won this 
        war if the nuclear explosion never happened in the first place…</p>
        <br>
    <p>He awakens again his body reforming, this is when James realizes he’s immortal, he clenches his fist and hits the ground cursing God<br>
        <i>:DAMMIT, JUST LET ME DIE PLEASE!</i><br>
        He screams in agony he falls to the ground tears forming in his eyes as he balls up and holds his knees, 
        after a few minutes James is knocked out by something…</p>
